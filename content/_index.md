We're transforming eye care in the NHS. Our team crosses institutional boundaries, made up of people from [NHSX](https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk), [NHS Digital](https://digital.nhs.uk), [NHSE/I](https://improvement.nhs.uk) and [Moorfields Eye Hospital](https://www.moorfields.nhs.uk). We're clinicians, delivery specialists, technologists and researchers.

We're building on [work done by others](https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/blogs/transforming-eye-care-services-through-better-connectivity/), to re-think *how eye care works*. 

The technology we use to diagnose and treat eye conditions has changed a lot in recent years, but the technology we use behind the scenes to connect our services together and make them work for patients is lagging behind. We want to change that.

This website is a place for us to share our progress with peers and colleagues, and think out loud for the benefit of other NHS teams and pathways that might tread the same path.
