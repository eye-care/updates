# Last week we:

* Set up the user-centred eye care website (this prototype!) to talk about what we are doing. We’ll use it to update our sponsors and collaborators on what we’ve done, what we’re doing next, and where we are blocked. Weeknotes and blog posts will be published here on a regular basis.
* Defined the Service Level work, needs & team. We will be starting small, taking existing maps and looking at contracts.
* Understanding the technology landscape with Moorfields pilots.  
* Met with High street optometrists to continue scoping their engagement.
* Started planning for further training on digital capabilities. We mapped the different audiences and their needs, outlining the groups that may benefit from digital ways of working training and the initial approach for capability building.
* Developed a one-pager for our implementation approach for our weekly sponsors meeting.
* Clarified the clinician roles on delivery teams. Clinicians will be part of the core team and be involved in agile ceremonies including planning, stand-ups, retrospectives. This will be providing guidance on clinically appropriate outcome and performance metrics, oversight of clinical validation of pathways.
* Supported the workforce team with planning around how the core team should look like and agree how to continue working together.
* Wardley mapping writeup [is available here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DB_jIaxzRirwCxS1LI-rf2mB259_BTgTM3sjppSAaGY/edit#slide=id.p1). More to follow!

* Worked on internal alignment with Moorfields community hubs.  

### Home Care
* We agreed the delivery team that will be running the Discovery, and agreed a start date of w/c 29th March
* We had several sessions with people who will either be part of the team or can support us in this space (e.g. optometry advisors at the NHSBSA) to support context setting before getting started in earnest.

### Data and analytics
* Continued to narrow down long list of metrics. Mapped metrics flowing from the ‘Programme Deliverables’ and ‘Secondary Drivers’ and requested feedback from the working group
* Continue to understand data gaps and where we can make recommendations on further collections
* Aiming to have a set of a small set of metrics to report upwards by the end of the month
* Started to build ‘Pathways to better health’ compartment in Model Health System to mock up first draft of how data could be presented
* Met with Sarah Cant (Director of Policy & Strategy - College of Optometrists) to discuss data flowing from optometry
* Met with Tom Stocker and Charis Stacey to discuss outpatient data and potential sources of primary care data
Requested access to GOS contracts data at system level

### Commissioning
* Working on the initial scoping including discussions with key individuals to identify and establish the core team going forward.
* Produced a summary report, including recommendations for consideration by the sponsor group.
