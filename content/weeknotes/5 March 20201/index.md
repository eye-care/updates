# Last week we:

* Had a great introduction session with SROs and all the workstreams. You can find out more about it here, or watch a recording here.

* Discussed the programme’s proposed approach to comms and publishing with NHSX and NHSE/I colleagues. We identified the likely blockers for escalation to sponsors.

* Met Lisa and Radikha (you can read about what they’re working on here) and agreed they will join the programme as workstreams and present at the sponsors calls. Our work has dependencies on theirs so it’s an important positive move.

* North West regional team - confirmed Greater Manchester is the right ICS to work with us on Hubs and potentially all the other workstreams. John has agreed to this.

* Spoken to the regional implementation teams about the skill mix they need, including digital roles embedded alongside the improvement directorate regional resources. We will start with the three selected regional teams and the selected ICSs.


* Had a metrics and data conversation with Ming’s team around how eye care can be a pilot for their new approach to basing transformation on better data.  Connected Pete with her team and we are hoping for a Tableau dashboard to represent data soon. Bryn agreed to set-up a follow-up meeting with David and members of Ming’s team to see how we develop the right metrics for the hubs and home care teams.


* Spoken to John about the commissioning workstream and targeting the three selected ICS. We need to identify people who can work on a national level and within them to understand the impact of our proposed transformation on commissioning models. We hope the service-level map will make the needs and dependencies easier to see and identify where to start with this work.


* Worked on understanding and aligning current offerings, digital platforms, and clinical services at Moorfields Eye Hospital so that benefits from the workstream can be delivered consistently across many care pathways.


* Had a couple of meeting with Getting It Right First Time - Tim and Graham. Started conversations about applying digital methodology to their work and how it could be rolled out to other specialities over time.


* Gloria has been designing workshop for the 17th with regional colleagues across specialities to bring them up to speed on the eye care programme.  


* We had our first agile training session for clinicians, project managers and data analysts joining as well.  This was a productive one hour session with some useful Q&A at the end. We will be building on this to add in further sessions to support the teams throughout.


## Hubs

* Onboarded 3 new team members and understanding more about the current high-level eye care patient journey

* London Regional team conversation - we agreed to have a session with them and the hubs team to understand the landscape.  


## Home Care

* Worked on standing up a team for this Discovery piece

* Spoke to some of our key stakeholders to get more context on this work, which will help us frame up the problem statement/Discovery goals

# This week we will:

* Meet with Caroline to discuss what the core team for Workforce workstream should look like and agree how to continue working together. We will be reaching out to some of you about it shortly.

* Support the hubs team to get going faster, aligning with existing things and infrastructure (cloud-based image stores etc)

* Start working on a service-level map to uncover connections between workstreams, commonalities, and areas that need more attention.

* Discuss how we can work more effectively together across all the workstreams and shift the format of the sponsor calls to a show & tell format.

* Set up show & tells for a broader audience.

* Continue to engage with high street optometry to understand how new models of distributed care can succeed.


## Hubs

* Team design workshop to break down work and detail out our user groups, assumptions, and hypotheses to test. These should form our backlog to start prioritising experiments to design next week.

* Some more work getting up to speed with one of the pilots run by Morefields involving common image sharing between hospitals and optometrists, and understanding the technology landscape

* Identify more team roles needed and how to hire for them

## Home Care

* Confirm team that will be working on this stream and start to build plans out from their start date

* Work with our clinical lead Dawn to agree problems looking to address through Discovery

* Progress internal governance/spend pieces
