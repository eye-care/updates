Our teams are working towards two long-term outcomes, agreed by our sponsors: 

* **A bold but grounded approach to transforming eye care**, to radically reduce friction for people who receive and deliver the service.
* **In so doing, create a replicable model for NHS transformation**, via cross-disciplinary teams applying the culture, processes, operating models and technologies of the internet era.

[This blog post](/blog/transforming-nhs-eye-care/) has a bit more background. 

This website is an experimental prototype to explore working in the open. It documents our work, as we do it. Expect frequent small changes and updates.
