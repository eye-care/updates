Our teams are working towards two long-term outcomes, agreed by our sponsors: 

* **A bold but grounded approach to transforming eye care**, to radically reduce friction for people who receive and deliver the service.
* **In so doing, create a replicable model for NHS transformation**, via cross-disciplinary teams applying the culture, processes, operating models and technologies of the internet era.

[This blog post](/blog/transforming-nhs-eye-care/) has a bit more background. 

This website is an experimental prototype to explore working in the open. It documents our work, as we do it. 

## How the programme is designed

The work is currently divided into 6 workstreams:

1. Pathway improvement and recovery
2. Digital ophthalmology hubs
3. Home care
4. Workforce optimisation
5. Date and analytics
6. Commissioning

So far, most of our work is focused on digital ophthalmology hubs and home care, but other workstreams are ramping up quickly.

We'll post frequent updates and weeknotes on the [blog](/blog/). Stay tuned.
