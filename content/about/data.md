## What we are doing

Developing of a set of benchmarking metrics to provide systems (via Model Health
System) with comparative information to identify variation and opportunities to
improve across the various elements of the Eye Care pathways.

Developing a measurement framework to track progress of the different elements of
the Eye Care pathway improvement work.

## Our approach

We will develop metrics related to the specific activities of the programme based on
the Eye Care Driver Diagram.

We will work with clinicians and other data users to ensure that the metric set is
presented to help systems to monitor progress against key deliverables and explore
supporting metrics that will provide additional contextual information.

## What will change

Systems will have access to better information to understand variation in
activity, access and outcomes and therefore, help to design better services for
patients.
