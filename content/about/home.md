## What we are doing

Will focus on offerings that allow patients to access care and manage their
conditions at home.

This includes capabilities like home vision and symptom monitoring,
patient-initiated follow-up models, well-structured patient information
resources, and easy-access video consultations.

## Our approach

We are deliberately taking a different approach

* Setting up empowered, multi-organisation, multi-disciplinary, 100%
dedicated teams.
* Focussing on outcomes, obsessed with meeting user needs.
* Starting small, moving fast, iteratively identifying and testing assumptions.
* Working in the open, thinking out loud.
* Adopting active, engaged, empowered governance methods to overcome
barriers as soon as they arise.

## What will change

At present, home care offerings remain locked in local siloes, and many
promising offerings are poorly validated.

We will accelerate both the spread of proven home care solutions, and provide
a resource that can support the rapid validation of new offerings at home.

The result will be more patients managed at home, better engaged with their
care, and clinical support more reactive to changing clinical condition.
