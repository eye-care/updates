## What we are doing

* Analysing of the ophthalmic workforce, under the digital hubs model to identify potential
gaps in provision and staffing.
* Expansion and development of current roles e.g. via agreed qualifications and
competencies for different roles.
* Recruitment to new roles, eg. Technicians.
* Clarity of focus on developing the primary care (optometry) workforce.
* Workforce development to align with optimising talent, retention and improving wellbeing.
* Understanding of regional variation, engaging with one or more regions.

## Our approach

* Supported through strong, high level governance. A multi-layered team approach.
* Agreed drivers, using driver diagrams.
* Broad multidisciplinary approach for workforce development, education and updated
clinical pathways input.
* Digital liaison for current and future workforce requirement models â€“ demand/capacity,
effective deployment, workforce optimisation, digital enablers.
* Work with one or two regions and/or systems.

## What will change

The development of a workforce of appropriate size and shape to deliver best practice
ophthalmic care across different regions through:

* recognition of what is required to deliver current care needs;
* an integrated approach to staff training, development and standardised
qualifications;
* optimising talent, skills development and staff wellbeing
* and regional implementation through a flexible approach to delivery.
