## What we are doing

Commissioning is a key enabler for the delivery of at least half of the 21/22
priority deliverables for the programme.

We are:
* Clarifying what is in and out of scope of this workstream, based on the
priority deliverables.
* Working up a plan with key milestones, resources and deliverables.

## Our approach

* Using the priority deliverables (i.e. changes to existing pathways and new
services) to determine scope of this workstream.
* Agreement of a number of principles recognising the differences between
sectors/providers and different levers to guide this work
* Working collaboratively with representatives from key stakeholders to
agree requirements and understanding appetite for risk/deliverability.

## What will change

* Understand baseline at national and ICS level to identify opportunities and
gaps to (re)allocate resource and deliver priorities.
* Identify financing and contracting/delivery requirements for priority
deliverables.
* Identification of commissioning mechanisms to enable delivery of priorities.
