## Introduction

Insert a quick intro to the programme overall here.

## Workstreams

We currently have six workstreams. They are clinician-led, and work in a user-centered, collaborative, and iterative way.


### Pathway improvement and recovery

An enhanced system-level improvement support to aid local leaders in recovery and delivering change on the ground.

Find out more [on the Pathway improvement and recovery page]({{< ref "/about/recovery.md" >}})




### Digital ophthalmology hubs

Building a “bottom up” model to support eye care delivery in non-hospital settings.

The hubs will be able to receive clinical data in a source-agnostic fashion, and return
the right clinical input needed to manage the patient.

This begins with user-research, and designing systems and technology that can
scale and adapt to new care offerings.

### Home care

Will focus on offerings that allow patients to access care and manage their
conditions at home.

This includes capabilities like home vision and symptom monitoring,
patient-initiated follow-up models, well-structured patient information

### Workforce optimisation

* Analysing of the ophthalmic workforce, under the digital hubs model to identify potential
gaps in provision and staffing.
* Expansion and development of current roles e.g. via agreed qualifications and
competencies for different roles.
* Recruitment to new roles, eg. Technicians.
* Clarity of focus on developing the primary care (optometry) workforce.
* Workforce development to align with optimising talent, retention and improving wellbeing.
* Understanding of regional variation, engaging with one or more regions.

### Data and analytics

Developing of a set of benchmarking metrics to provide systems (via Model Health
System) with comparative information to identify variation and opportunities to
improve across the various elements of the Eye Care pathways.

Developing a measurement framework to track progress of the different elements of
the Eye Care pathway improvement work.

### Commissioning

Commissioning is a key enabler for the delivery of at least half of the 21/22
priority deliverables for the programme.

We are:
* Clarifying what is in and out of scope of this workstream, based on the
priority deliverables.
* Working up a plan with key milestones, resources and deliverables.
