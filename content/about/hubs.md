## What we are doing


Building a “bottom up” model to support eye care delivery in non-hospital settings.

The hubs will be able to receive clinical data in a source-agnostic fashion, and return
the right clinical input needed to manage the patient.

This begins with user-research, and designing systems and technology that can
scale and adapt to new care offerings.

## Our approach

We are deliberately taking a different approach

* Setting up empowered, multi-organisation, multi-disciplinary, 100%
dedicated teams.
* Focussing on outcomes, obsessed with meeting user needs.
* Starting small, moving fast, iteratively identifying and testing assumptions.
* Working in the open, thinking out loud.
* Adopting active, engaged, empowered governance methods to overcome
barriers as soon as they arise.

## What will change

Access to ophthalmology expertise will be possible without a visit to the hospital.
Creating services like shared care with community optometry, or which utilise a high
volume community imaging hub, will become much easier when they can plug into a
pre-existing resource to provide clinical management of the patient.

The result should be more patients seen in non-hospital settings, and much more
rapid innovation around new care pathways.
