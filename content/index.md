This is the user-centred eye care team’s website. We’ll use it to update our sponsors and collaborators on what we’ve done, what we’re doing next, and where we are blocked.

A bold but grounded approach to transforming eye care, to radically reduce friction for people who receive and deliver the service.

In so doing create a replicable model for NHS transformation, via cross-disciplinary teams applying the culture, processes, operating models and technologies of the internet-era.
