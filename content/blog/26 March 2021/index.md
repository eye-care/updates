## A note from Iain O’Neil

This week was challenging, but why wouldn’t it be? What we are doing - eye care transformation - is difficult, the system is complex, dispersed and huge. On top of that, we are using an approach that’s entirely new for many of us - the ‘digital methodology’ as we are calling it. And we are applying it on top of, or in place of, an existing and already in-flight approach - we are building the plane as it flies through the sky.

This is not going to be easy, but it is incredibly important, especially for those of us who believe in the digital approach and its power to help us transform services for all users - this is our chance. But we have to find the balance between leaning into our methods, and not becoming so impenetrable and theoretical that our partners cannot engage with us. We need to find a way to blend our teams, our skills and our experiences. We need to continue to build the feeling of ‘one team’ - not ‘digital’ and ‘non-digital’, but one group of people working together to deliver better outcomes for eye-care patients and clinicians.

## Things that happened 

* We had our **first show & tell**! Felt like a big moment. You can find a [recording here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y8bcB7inND7re0OdNAOhZVYHT7kIEsO4). The next one will be on 9 April. 
* We made a lot of progress on staffing with more expected next week. We’re well on track to having sufficient teams on all the workstreams in near future. Once this is done, we will start thinking about who is needed for the next stage of Digital Hubs work and seeking them out. 
* We are working out how collaboration tools (Trello, Mural, Slack) need to be procured in order for teams to be able to work seamlessly in multi-organisational setup. We put a couple of options to our IG lead and will discuss them on Monday. 
* We continued to set up North-Central London specific outcomes and team, with a draft roadmap and workshop with workstream leads expected by 1 April. 
* Built this website prototype, for working in the open
* Showed the prototype to sponsors, delivery group & others. Working with colleagues to iterate it.

## Workstreams 

### Digital Hubs

#### Last week

Onboard a new member of the team Natalie who will support the team on Business Analysis activities.  The team spent some time mapping and thinking about the end to end journey, highlighting any pain points, and how we might go about prototyping the service and testing with users.  

Then, towards the end of the week, we shifted approach to focusing more on what parts of the Digital Hub was already being delivered by Moorfields, and how we can iterate and learn from the different parts of a digital hub. We crystallized our goal for the short term into this:

> Prove we can support one patient through the digital hub in north central London ICS (but outside Moorfields catchment area).

This will be iterating out the referral refinement part of the Digital Hub - but will help us learn a lot about delivering a clinical service at an ICS level. The team then delivered their thinking about next steps at a programme wide Show and Tell.

#### This week we will 

Understand what we need to do to get a digital hub registered as a formal care provider in NCL, and progressing the work to map out how the regional eERS procurement work will impact wide scale eye care transformation of the Programme.

### Home Care

#### Last week

We hosted an assumptions mapping session with our clinical lead to understand a first view of who our users will be and what problems we will be looking to tackle. We gathered alot of insights which we will review and discuss with the team.

We have also finalised our team in collaboration with the digital partners of the NHSBSA.

We gathered insight from the Programme Leaders about the opportunity, problem statements, existing structures and greenfield sites to build upon in this project.

Collaborated across workstream to understand dependency and opportunities available.

#### This week we will 

Onboard the new team to the NHSBSA, the Programme and begin our mobilisation period of the project.

We will get tooling, structures, cadence and plans in place to commence live sprinting from 12th April.

Gather further insights into existing Moorfields pilots, technology and increase relationships with our clinical partners.

### Workforce

#### Last week

Attended an ‘Improvement & Workforce Recovery Support Offer Workshop’ and gained useful insights into current workforce challenges within the NHS. 

Clarified the workstream interdependencies and collaborated with other workstreams to learn about their own workforce assumptions. 

Started to refine potential outcomes for the workforce optimisation in order to identify pieces of work for scoping the current challenges. 

#### This week we will 

Meet with the Workforce lead in MSK to discuss how best to integrate alongside other workstreams. 

Start analysing GIRFT reports and questionnaires from NCL.
Continue discovering workforce assumptions within other workstreams.
Meet with RCOphth fellow to begin reviewing Workforce Matrix and Capacity and Demand Tools used by NHSE. 

Arranging consistent meetings with HEE.
