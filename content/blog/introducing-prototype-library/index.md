We try small things, see how they work, see how they don't work, and make iterative small changes to make them better.

We're taking the same approach with comms and publishing, and as part of that work we've built a very simple [online document library](/library/) for publishing documents that eye care professionals (clinical and non-clinical) will be interested in.

## A roadmap for restoration after Covid-19

Right now, the library is just a few documents. The one that's likely to interest most people is the eye care restoration roadmap. 

It's a plan for eye care recovery after Covid-19, which has delayed many services and delayed appointments. With ophthalmology services under increased pressure, and given the NHS Long Term Plan recommendation to avoid unnecessary face-to-face outpatient appointments, this roadmap shows the way ahead.

It sets out opportunities for transforming local eye care systems, and four principles for scaling up good practice. (There's related information on the Eye Care Hub and in the Eye Care Digital Playbook.)

Alongside the roadmap, there's some other documents that go into detail about pathway design and high flow services (including case studies).

## Change is just another iteration away

Many of these documents are still in draft and subject to change. 

The document library itself is likely to change too - as I said at the outset, this is an experimental, iterative approach. We're learning as we go. The library might look, behave and be somewhere different once we know about meeting the needs of people who need to access documents like this.

The best way to understand those needs is start. 

If you have any feedback about this small first start, I'm keen to hear them. Getting information like this out to the people who need to see it is a crucial part of transforming eye care - if you're one of those people, and you have a view, please get in touch.
