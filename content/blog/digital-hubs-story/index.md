We've started work on designing what we call a "digital hub" for eye care. 

When we say “hub”, we mean something - probably a digital service operating over the internet - that acts as a link between *sources* of medical data, and *people* with the expertise to interpret it.

In the model we're working with, the hub accepts incoming data (such as retina scans) from any source, and makes it easy for the right clinician to examine that data remotely. 

The result: more patients get the eye care they need, without having to make so many visits to specialist units in hospitals. Expert eye care clinicians can put their expertise to good use, without having to be in the same room, in a hospital, with the patient sitting in front of them. In medical technical terms, the hub separates *collecting* data from *interpreting* data - which means we can run clinics virtually.

The planned upshot of that is we end up making better use of clinicians’ valuable and limited time, and provide a simpler, smoother, faster service for patients.

The "any source" bit is important: we believe that whatever we build should be source-agnostic, software-agnostic, and pathway-agnostic. In other words, it should be designed from the ground up to be flexible and interoperable with many other systems and technologies. 

Many of these concepts have been proven since Covid, with plenty of innovation and delivery of clinical services remotely. That’s been underpinned by access to high quality data, which ensures high quality decisions.

The technology that makes the hub should be flexible too. It should be possible for us to switch out and re-arrange different parts of it quickly, should the need arise.

That’s the theory. In practice, things are a little more complicated.

## Narrowing our scope

In week 3 we started to learn about a project run at [Moorfields Hospital Croydon](https://www.moorfields.nhs.uk/site/moorfields-eye-centre-croydon) in south London, that had already begun running a similar experiment – more or less a prototype of the referral refinement service we were thinking of. 

As a result, week 4 was a bit of a breakthrough: we changed course to focus on iterating on the work that had already been done in Croydon, and we drastically reduced our scope. Even though we have big ambitions, we need to start small.

So we settled on a much more focused short-term goal:

> Prove that we can support *one* patient through the digital hub in the [North Central London](https://northcentrallondonccg.nhs.uk/about-us/our-plans/integrated-care-system/) (NCL) [Integrated Care System](https://www.england.nhs.uk/integratedcare/what-is-integrated-care/) (but outside [Moorfields Eye Hospital](https://www.moorfields.nhs.uk/) catchment area).

One patient might not sound very ambitious, but this is a learning exercise. If we understand the barriers and blockers that get in the way with one patient, we can set about removing or changing them so that many more patients, in many more Integrated Care Systems around the country, can follow behind.

The first task was to find a way to engage with the team at the North Central London (NCL) Integrated Care System. By week 7, we’d contacted them and started conversations.

## Transformation is more than technology

It’s striking how much of this work so far has been about transformation, but not really about technology. (Although, yes: quite a lot of it is about technology.)

One aspect of that has been about growing the team: When we started, we had only 2 full-time team members. Now we have 8. One thing we learned quickly in the early weeks was that we really needed full-time brains working on a challenge like this one. 

Another aspect has been considering the operational side of the work: What about governance? Commissioning? Funding? Staffing? Performance monitoring? We have to consider all of these things, even while our immediate goal remains supporting one patient through a new hub service.

It’s work worth doing now, because solving big problems and addressing big assumptions for a small goal like this will help us solve and address the same things when we want to scale up.

We couldn’t have made the progress we’ve made without lots of help from colleagues at Moorfields, NCL, and across the NHS. Grateful thanks to all of them.
