This provides commissioners, decision makers and those holding the pen on local planning returns with the right level of information relating to eyes, so that they can start planning for local eye care transformation. 

It's important to get this information out to as many stakeholders as possible. Eye care transformation is a priority for the NHS, and the document spells out what is expected in the coming year.

Transformation will require change at every level of the system and across a wide range of stakeholders, so effective communication and engagement is essential. The guidance sets out what’s needed from the NHSE/I regional teams, ICSs and providers. 

## Growing a team

Over the last month, the Pathways team has grown from just myself and Mel Hingorani as the Clinical Leads, to a full team of people with a full time Programme Manager, two part time Digital Capability Leads, a Delivery Manager, a Clinical fellow/Registrar Ophthalmologist and an Outpatients Redesign Senior Manager all working together as a team. 

By pooling our collective expertise we will ensure all outcomes from our workstream are  greater than the sum of our individual contributions; as a team, we now have the right skills to ensure the pathways workstream works in an agile way, has sufficient day to day programme leadership, alongside strong clinical leadership. 

As an optometrist with 25 years experience in primary care delivery and service improvement,  my role is to help explain the “offer” primary care optometry can bring to eye care transformation. My contribution to the pathway workstream will both complement and balance the clinical leadership delivered by Mel, as someone with equal experience and passion for eye care transformation, working at the other end of the patient pathway. Together we will lead by example and aim to demonstrate how collaboration can deliver great outcomes and ultimately a sustainable model for eye care provision across England.

My priority is to produce a package of support to inform and implement an “Optometry First” service, bringing together the existing tried and tested extended primary care pathways under one umbrella to make optimal use of the primary eye care workforce, as first contact practitioners, and so turning off the tap on referral activity. This is a service every system can commission utilising the existing primary care capability. 

The team has already celebrated its first significant milestone - beyond Mel and I eventually getting to grips with the new digital methodology - the recent release of the planning annex demonstrated great teamwork and effective communication across the workstreams and senior leadership team to turn it around at lightning speed.  

A big thank you to all those colleagues from each NHS region who participated in the regional calls we had with the other specialties.


## Next steps

The pathway workstream now have two immediate priorities:

* Set up a National Eye Care Board
* Renew and refresh the NOTP “Roadmap” and resources

In order to transform eye care at scale, there needs to be an effective structure and system for decision making, accountability, sharing and learning. Regions are asked to establish regional eye care boards, at the same time systems bring together local stakeholders into an eye care delivery group, whilst nationally we will set up an eye care board. 

Whilst the planning annex sets out the high level “asks” there needs to be a more detailed support document to provide the “how to”. Building on the work already started under the National OutPatient Transformation programme, and co-produced by clinicians, commissioners, patients and professional organisations, we will bring up to date the eye care road map and supporting resources.

A first draft is already out for consultation with our pathway reference group and we eagerly await their feedback.
