Clinicians appreciate it too, because eye care is a very important part of general health care, and often a first line of defence for spotting other conditions.

The technology used to provide eye care has moved fast in recent years. Most of us have become accustomed to being sat in front of various different machines when we go for an eye test. Retina scans are routine things that happen on every high street. There is a growing evidence base that shows how technology helps clinicians make better diagnoses, faster.

But behind the scenes, the processes the NHS uses to manage patient data and patient care are still quite old-fashioned. Patients and staff end up feeling the consequences of avoidable problems and delays.

Patients who need further checks or expert care end up having to go to eye care units in hospitals, where they can face long waits to see a specialist or use a particular piece of equipment.

We're confident that there's a better way of delivering that care, while making more efficient use of clinicians’ time.

We think that a lot of the existing processes could be re-arranged and digitised to make things more efficient. We could reduce the burden on GPs, make more use of high street optometrists and other community-based services with state-of-the-art equipment, and enable more patients to do self-care from home. That would free up hospital units to provide services to patients with the most urgent or serious need.

## The plan so far

We're going to transform eye care in the NHS, exploring ways to use a digital approach to re-arrange and re-organise how eye care works. We’re not starting from scratch; this is building on a lot of work already done.

Transformation isn’t something that happens all at once. We'll start with a small piece of it, and test our assumptions as we scale.

Our first project is about what we call "digital eyecare hubs". A hub would provide specialist eye care remotely, using a mix of video consultations and clinical data transferred digitally (and securely) from other locations.

We think it would make much more efficient use of time, especially that of eye care specialists. Their most important task is usually checking through data and making a diagnosis, then recommending treatment. That doesn't always need to be done with the patient in the room - most of it can be done remotely, effectively. We’ll write more about digital hub in the coming weeks and months.

## A new way of working

In recent weeks, we've been assembling a multidisciplinary team to get started. As well as bringing together many different skills - clinical, design, user research, technology and others - it also brings together a lot of organisations. There are people from NHSx, NHSE/I, NHS Digital, NHSBSA and Moorfields Eye Hospital on the team. That’s important. This is transformation for the whole NHS, not just one unit of it.  

With that in mind, we are deliberately taking a different approach:

* Setting up empowered, multi-organisation, multi-disciplinary, 100% dedicated teams

* Focussing on outcomes, obsessed with meeting user needs

* Starting small, moving fast, iteratively identifying and testing assumptions

* Working in the open, thinking out loud (that's what this blog post is the start of)

* Adopting active, engaged, empowered governance methods to overcome barriers as soon as they arise


We're confident that this is the right approach, not least because we're basing a lot of our planning decisions on the technology vision for the NHS document published back in 2018.

It said:

“We need to focus on getting the basics right”

and listed 4 simple principles:

* user need
* privacy and security
* interoperability and openness
* inclusion


That vision gives us a clear foundation to build on, and a clear set of instructions for getting started. We’re starting with eye care, but are planning to apply what works to other clinical pathways as well.
