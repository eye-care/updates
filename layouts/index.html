This is the user-centred eye care team’s website. We’ll use it to update our sponsors and collaborators on what we’ve done, what we’re doing next, and where we are blocked.
<br><br>
The team is working towards two long-term outcomes, agreed by our sponsors:

<ul>
<li>A bold but grounded approach to transforming eye care, to radically reduce friction for people who receive and deliver the service.</li>
<br>
<li>In so doing create a replicable model for NHS transformation, via cross-disciplinary teams applying the culture, processes, operating models and technologies of the internet-era.</li>
</ul>  </p>
